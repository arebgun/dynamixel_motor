    <description brief="Python drivers for Robotis Dynamixel servos">
        This package provides low level IO for Robotis Dynamixel servos. 
        Fully supports and was tested with AX-12+, RX-28, RX-64, EX-106+
        models. Hardware specific constants are defined for  reading and
        writing information from/to Dynamixel servos. This low level
        package won't be used directly by most users. The higher level
        dynamixel_controllers and specific robot controllers use this
        package.
